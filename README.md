IMPORTANT NOTE:
1) This repository is ACTIVELY being updated and represents a WORK IN PROGRESS. Please check again tomorrow if you see something wrong and likely the issue will already have been fixed. :)

2) I create these programs/functions in my free time and they do not represent any professional development.
They are not perfect, and although I carefully aim to create good programs, they will have mistakes and quirks.
IF YOU NOTICE ANYTHING UNUSUAL about how the programs/functions behave, PLEASE email me at electricalengineeringexpanded@gmail.com.
I am constantly learning and hope to create better quality programs in the future.
Sincerely,
jaredsbror :)

Windows.tns - Used in filtering signals and extracting data via convolution with Window functions

Energy.tns - Used to calculate the energy of both discrete-time and continuous-time signals

Power.tns - Used to calculate the power of both discrete-time and continuous-time, periodic signals

Functions.tns - Used to generate function definitions for unit step (heaviside) functions, as well as rect, triangle, and sinc functions

Mag.tns - Used to determine the magnitude response of a pole/zero plot in both Laplace and Z-Domain

Resistors.tns - (1) Determine parallel resistance (2) Determine which missing resistor value produces a specific equivalent resistance

Ohms.tns - Determine the power, current, voltage, and resistance of very simple circuits
